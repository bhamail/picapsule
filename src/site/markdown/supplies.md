Pi Supplies
===========

Here's a quick list of hardware you need to build this puppy. In addition to
the items listed below, you need a network connection (network cable or 
Wifi). A video display, USB Keyboard and Mouse are optional, as most everything
can be done via `ssh`.

  1. A [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/). 
     I've used a [Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) with [8gb RAM](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/?variant=raspberry-pi-4-model-b-8gb) because they are readily available at the time of this writing.
  
     By the time you read this, bht [Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) may be available.     

  3. USB Power supply: 
  
     At least a [3 amp USB-C Power supply for Pi 4](https://www.newark.com/raspberry-pi/sc0218/5-1v-3a-usb-c-psu-us-black-rohs/dp/03AH7034).
     There are many others available.
 
     A beefier [5 amp USB-C power supply](https://vilros.com/products/raspberry-pi-5-official-power-supply?utm_source%5B0%5D=google&utm_source%5B1%5D=google&utm_medium%5B0%5D=product_sync&utm_medium%5B1%5D=cpc&utm_campaign%5B0%5D=sag_organic&utm_campaign%5B1%5D=&utm_term=&utm_content%5B0%5D=sag_organic&utm_content%5B1%5D=90618046730) would probably be better for a Pi 5.

  4. 32GB microSD card w/ SD adapter
