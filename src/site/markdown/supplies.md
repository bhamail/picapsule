Pi Supplies
===========

Here's a quick list of hardware you need to build this puppy. In addition to
the items listed below, you need a network connection (network cable or 
Wi-Fi). A video display, USB Keyboard and Mouse are optional, as most everything
can be done via `ssh`.

  1. A [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/). 
     I've used a [Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) with [8gb RAM](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/?variant=raspberry-pi-4-model-b-8gb) because they are readily available at the time of this writing.
  
     By the time you read this, bht [Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) may be available.     

  2. USB Power supply: 
  
     At least a [3 amp USB-C Power supply for Pi 4](https://www.newark.com/raspberry-pi/sc0218/5-1v-3a-usb-c-psu-us-black-rohs/dp/03AH7034).
     There are many others available.
 
     A beefier [5 amp USB-C power supply](https://vilros.com/products/raspberry-pi-5-official-power-supply?utm_source%5B0%5D=google&utm_source%5B1%5D=google&utm_medium%5B0%5D=product_sync&utm_medium%5B1%5D=cpc&utm_campaign%5B0%5D=sag_organic&utm_campaign%5B1%5D=&utm_term=&utm_content%5B0%5D=sag_organic&utm_content%5B1%5D=90618046730) would probably be better for a Pi 5.

  3. 32GB microSD card w/ SD adapter

  4. A big 'ole USB hard drive. This could be a spinning disk or an SSD. I decided the extra cost of an SSD would be 
     worthwhile because the SDD will be faster and use less electricity over its lifetime. The really important word
     here is "big". Time Machine will back up your entire Mac, so the backup disk you use should have at least twice the
     storage space of your Mac. 
 
     I went with a [4tb SSD](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B25M8FXX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) (Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 3D NAND NVMe M.2 SSD, up to 5000MB/s - CT4000P3PSSD8)
     
     ![SSD](images/supplies/SSD-NVMe-M.2.png)
     
     and this [USB M.2 NVME SATA SSD Enclosure Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNFH1PX?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). (SSK Aluminum M.2 NVME SATA SSD Enclosure Adapter, USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) to NVME PCI-E SATA M-Key/(B+M) Key Solid State Drive External Enclosure Support UASP Trim for NVME/SATA SSDs 2242/2260/2280)

     ![SSD Enclosure](images/supplies/Enclosure-M.2-NMVE-SSD.png)

     For those who want the fastest possible solution, the Pi 5 has a PCI Express interface available via a ribbon cable
     and adapter. As I said, I'm desirous of a Pi 5, but couldn't find one as of this writing.
